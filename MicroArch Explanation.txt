1. We created the Product service, Order Service & Created a Discovery Server (Eureka registry) where we've added spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server
 dependency & @EnableEurekaServer annotation so that it will acts as eureka server which maintains all the eureka clients so that load balancer can detect the appropiate microservice to call

 Also for tihe clients i.e. Product & order service we've just added the client dependency, configured the applicaton name , as we've added the client dependency, clients will automatically look for the
 eureka server by first checking to its default port at 8761 & we've specified the same port in our discovery-server microserve so both the clients will automatically catches the server and registers themselves there.
